<ol>
  <li>C++ is a beautiful and a better language for competitive (I have experience using Python.)</li>
  <li>Try to learn basics of map, array and vector.</li>
  <li>Have basic knowledge of Algorithm.</li>
  <li>Try differet approach of solving when stuck.</li>
  <li>Never lose hope. Cant solve one! Leave it for a day and start next day with a clear mind :)</li>
  <li>Remove useless details from the question.</li>
  <li>Try to use scanf and printf (They are a lot faster trust me!)</li>
  <li>Always use long long int when in doubt. Always check the constraints.</li>
  <li>Never lose Hope. Rating Doesnt matter</li>
